Ramp
 • It is a Python library that is used for the rapid prototyping of 
machine-learning models

NumPy is one of the fundamental packages for Python, 
providing support for large multidimensional arrays and 
matrices along with a collection of high-level mathematical 
functions to execute these functions swiftly.

TensorFlowʼs most popular deep learning framework is an 
open-source software library for high-performance 
numerical computation.

PyTorch
 • Introduced by Facebook in 2017, PyTorch is a Python 
package that gives the user a blend of 2 high-level features – 
Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU 
acceleration and the development of Deep Neural Networks 
on a tape-based auto diff system. 

Pandas
